## Powered by

This example is powered by the following services:
- [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/) (AI API)
- [Bytescale](https://www.bytescale.com/) (storage)
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com) (hosting, serverless functions, analytics)

## How it works

It uses gpt3.5 turbo api on [Open_AI](https://platform.openai.com/) to analyze a contract for malicious content and then gives the user the ability to sign the contract they uploaded. It does this by prompting the user for two email adderesses: 
1.For the First Signer on the contract, 
2.The second Signer of the contract

3. Click on "Account" in the navbar. And, here you can find your API token, copy it.

### Creating a account on ByteScale to get an API key.

1. Go to [ByteScale](https://www.bytescale.com/) to make an account.
2. Get the api key and paste it in .env

### Storing API key in .env file.

Create a file in root directory of project with env. And store your API key in it, as shown in the .example.env file.

If you'd also like to do rate limiting, create an account on UpStash, create a Redis database, and populate the two environment variables in `.env` as well. If you don't want to do rate limiting, you don't need to make any changes.

### Installing the dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

### Running the application.

Then, run the application in the command line and it will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

```bash
npm run dev
```
